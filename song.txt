… Love, I have wounds
Only you can mend
You can mend, oh, oh, oh
I guess that's love
I can't pretend
I can't pretend, oh, oh, oh
… Feel, my skin is rough
But it can be cleansed
It can be cleansed, oh, oh, oh
… And my arms are tough
But they can be bent
They can be bent
And I wanna fight
But I can't contend
… I guess that's love
I can't pretend
I can't pretend, oh, oh, ooh-oh
oh oh oh
… Whoa
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
… Oh, feel our bodies grow
And our souls they play, yeah
Yeah love I hope you know
How much my heart depends, yeah
… But I guess that's love I can't pretend
I guess that's love I can't pretend, oh, oh
But I guess that's love I can't pretend
I guess that's love I can't pretend, oh, oh
… Oh, feel our bodies grow
And our souls they play, yeah
Yeah love I hope you know
How much my heart depends, yeah
… I guess that's love
I can't pretend
I can't pretend, oh, oh, oh
… I guess that's love
I can't pretend
I can't pretend, oh, oh, oh
